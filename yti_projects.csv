11,"Just-in-Time Disability Toolkitâ¢",,"Leading in a Disability Inclusive Environment",,"<p>The Just-in-Time Disability Toolkit project creates research-based &ldquo;toolkit&rdquo; websites for organizations interested in enhancing their disability inclusiveness. Each toolkit is customized to an organization&rsquo;s policies and practices. We use the organization&rsquo;s images and language to talk about disability at work and reinforce organizational messages about inclusion, and we link to organizational resources that support disability inclusion.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>These toolkit sites divide complex disability issues into standalone &ldquo;tools.&rdquo; Each tool is crafted to provide helpful and accurate information, understandable advice, and best practices within a specific disability-related topic. The tools support communication about disability inclusion within the organization and are designed to be an always available resource that complements existing training efforts in this area. Topics include inclusion, etiquette, hiring, disability disclosure, self-identification, mental health, coaching, and more.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We offer two toolkits. One is aimed at the unique concerns of managers and the other focuses on questions typically posed by employees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Just-in-Time Toolkit for Managers:</strong> Did you know that 60% of employees are more likely to disclose a disability to their direct supervisor than to HR? These frontline managers and supervisors provide crucial support to an organization&rsquo;s disability diversity efforts. The Just-in-Time Toolkit for Managers helps an organization develop a culture for people to feel safe identifying their disability to managers, allowing all employees to have the potential to contribute fully to the organization&rsquo;s goals. This toolkit prepares managers to support employees around disability disclosure, reasonable accommodation, and performance management.</li>
<li><strong>Just-in-Time Toolkit for Employees:</strong> Did you know that although people with disabilities represent the largest diversity population in our country today, many organizations are still working to develop a culture that is inclusive of those with disabilities? Also, many employees are struggling to develop comfort in working alongside people with disabilities. The purpose of the customizable Just-in-Time Toolkit for Employees is to highlight an organization&rsquo;s commitment to including people with disabilities and reinforce the idea that diversity includes disability. It will also educate employees about supporting co-workers with disabilities and accessing information about the accommodation process, should the need arise. The toolkit is an excellent way to reinforce an organization&rsquo;s self-identification campaigns.</li>

Secondly, it will help to determine the possibility of using SHGs as models for advocating for equal rights and social and economic inclusion of people with disabilities in developing countries.</p>
<p>The SHGs typically consist of between nine to 12 members and are organized primarily to support micro-credit systems for enabling access to financial resources needed for work and livelihood. The project's focus is to use SHGs as tools for institution building for people to enhance their social, economic and community inclusion.</p>
<p>This study evaluates the social, economic, and community integration impacts on people with disabilities who are participating in SHGs. It is being conducted in the rural areas of the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in India. Without intervention, the people in this study would likely live in difficult circumstances and struggle to get ahead.</p>","<p>The first part of this study surveyed 900 families of persons with disabilities, which included those who participated in SHGs and those who did not. This survey examined multi-dimensional poverty among the SHG participants and non-participants. The findings from the study were presented at the Human Development Capability Association conference in Athens, Greece.</p>
<p>The second part of the study was based on a qualitative approach where 16 focus groups were conducted to understand if SHGs can be used as models for community-based rehabilitation for persons with disabilities.

<p>The Northeast ADA Center provides a variety of trainings and technical assistance, and it distributes materials focused on disability-related topics. It is not an enforcement agency and does not provide advocacy services.</p>","<p><strong>Outreach:</strong> Our outreach efforts create awareness of Center services and build trust with stakeholders, so as to increase the use of Center services. We conduct general outreach to ADA stakeholders in our region with our social media, website, and newsletter. We also plan to reach out to a few specific audiences this grant cycle. These include employment service professionals, youth with disabilities, and physical access professionals.</p>

TA specialists with expertise in various facets of the ADA (and other disability regulations) respond to direct, on-demand requests from stakeholders, connecting them with individually tailored information, referrals, and resources.</p>
<p><strong>Training:</strong> Our training efforts aim to increase stakeholder understanding of specific topics relevant to specific stakeholder groups. We will continue our efforts to build capacity, enhancing our ability to change intent and behavior around ADA implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity building:</strong> The purpose of capacity building is to aid in ADA implementation and to facilitate change in policy, practice, and behavior within communities. We use the ADA Trainer Leadership Network (TLN) and Customized Service Agreement with targeted stakeholders to empower advocates with information that they can share to support local community change initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Research:</strong> The Center&rsquo;s research seeks to identify region-specific barriers, facilitators, and best practices for implementing the ADA. Our first project will examine the experiences of employers and employees with disabilities related to workplace flexibility policies and practices and implementation of Title I of the ADA. The second research project will demonstrate the impact of our largest capacity building project, the ADA Trainer Leadership Network (TLN), by mapping changes in policy, practice, and behavior that result from the efforts of TLN members.</p>","<p style=""font-weight: 400;""><strong>Hotline:</strong> 800-949-4232<br /><strong>Adminstrative:</strong> 607-255-8660<br /><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=""mailto:northeastada@cornell.edu"">northeastada@cornell.edu</a></p>",18,"National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR)","Wendy Strobel Gower","<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Northeast ADA Center is part of the ADA National Network.

NYS PROMISE was vital because research has shown that youth who receive SSI typically do not successfully transition from high school to adulthood.</p>
<p>The long-term goals of NYS PROMISE included enhancing both employment and educational outcomes for youth with disabilities who receive SSI and improving economic, employment, and educational results for their families. NYS PROMISE brought together the NYS Governor's Office, state disability agencies, the Yang-Tan Institute, local schools, regional parent centers, local service providers, and other transition stakeholders to find the most effective ways to help transform the lives of youth who receive SSI.</p>","<p>NYS PROMISE was a five-year research project that advanced employment and postsecondary education outcomes for youth with disabilities between the ages of 14 -16 who were receiving SSI and their families. NYS PROMISE enrolled 2,000 of these youth who lived in western New York State, the capital region, or the New York City areas. Eligible families received special invitations to NYS PROMISE orientation and recruitment events through their child's school and/or regional parent center.</p>
<p>Of the 2,000 enrolled youth, 1,000 youth were randomly placed in a control group and continued receiving usual transition and education services provided through their local communities, and 1,000 youth were randomly selected to receive additional coordinated NYS PROMISE intervention services and supports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NYS PROMISE:</p>
<ul>
<li>developed strong and effective partnerships with agencies that provided key services to youth who received SSI and their families;</li>
<li>implemented effective practices at local demonstration sites, targeted to the needs of young SSI recipients and their families;</li>
<li>evaluated interventions via rigorous project design and data collection procedures.</li>

This research is critical, given that people with disabilities have been found to experience more work and life stress than their peers without disabilities and tend to enter the workforce later and leave it sooner, often due to disability-related concerns.</p>","<p>Whether a person with a disability or not, it is essential to find the proper balance between work and other life domains. This study is one of the first to investigate the specific work-life experiences and strategies of individuals with disabilities. Findings from this project may help our understanding of how individuals with disabilities find satisfying, sustainable employment, enabling longer, more productive careers.</p>
<p>The Work-Life Balance study provided new knowledge about how people with disabilities effectively manage work-life negotiations, what employer policies and practices contribute to a positive balance for these workers, and best practices employers and disability service providers can engage in to help individuals with disabilities to find and retain employment.</p>","<p>The first phase of the study included fielding a survey to the networks of over 100 organizations that serve individuals with disabilities(e.g., regional ADA Technical Assistance Centers, Centers for Independent Living, and organizations that serve people with specific types of disabilities/chronic health conditions).

<p>Identifying barriers to improve the current situation and employer practices that advance the employment of people with disabilities is imperative and the aim of this project. The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Employer Practices Related to the Employment Outcomes Among Individuals with Disabilities (EPRRTC) seeks to create new knowledge of specific employer practices most strongly associated with desired employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities and the prevalence of these practices.</p>","<ul>
<li><strong>Review of Employer Practices Literature:</strong> Literature related to research on employer best-practices supporting the hiring, retention, and promotion of people with disabilities. These articles study the demand (employer) side of the employment equation, focusing on the ways in which employer policies and practices affect the employment outcomes of individuals with disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Datasets:</strong> Browse across 11 major datasets for variables related to&nbsp;disability and health conditions, work and employer characteristics. The catalog provides&nbsp;variable names, survey questions, response categories and related variables that can be exported into an excel spreadsheet for your use.</li>
<li><strong>EEOC Charges:</strong> Key findings to date in an examination of data on employment discrimination charges filed under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Trends and patterns in these data, such as charge filing rates and characteristics of employer receiving charges, are provided and the implications and the importance of employer practice in minimizing perceived disability workplace discrimination are discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation:</strong> In this study, several comprehensive national demographic surveys are linked by occupation to rich occupation-level data on benefits to construct a careful measure of total compensation. These are used to explore the pay gaps between workers with disabilities and their non-disabled peers. Considerable heterogeneity is found in these estimated gaps by measures of pay, definition of disability and data source used.</li>
<li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Access to healthcare remains to be a critical element in the&nbsp;employment of persons with disabilities. Utilizing nationally existing restricted-access secondary datasets, we observed that access to employer-paid health insurance reduced job-mobility among employees with disabilities and led to longer work-tenure. This research demonstrates the value of offering health insurance in retaining qualified employees with disabilities. The findings of the Cornell research, in light of upcoming changes in health insurance policies as a result of the&nbsp;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Research was conducted using the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET to consider characteristics of jobs that are more likely associated with persons with disabilities and their non-disabled peers. Results illustrate and evaluate whether persons with disabilities are in different kinds of jobs and how 'in demand' specific job types are. In addition, whether persons with disabilities are over-or under-represented in the fastest growing jobs is discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Aging:</strong> This project presents a survey, conducted in collaboration with the Disability Management Employers Coalition (DMEC), which examined leading practices for retaining an aging workforce from the perspective of over 800 disability management professionals.</li>
<li><strong>Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) Survey:</strong> This project presents the findings and implications of data gathered from over 675 human resources professionals from the membership of the Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM). This employer survey measured the level of implementation and effectiveness of a wide variety of disability-inclusive practices and policies and examined perceived barriers to the employment of persons with disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Conference Board Working Groups:</strong> Employers' perceptions are critical input to increasing understanding of how to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities. A series of six focus groups of employer representatives from memberships of the Conference Board and the Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies at Cornell University were conducted to identify key issues of concern, policies and practices seen as currently effective, emerging issues, as well as to seek input in shaping the Employer Practices RRTC research agenda, and review preliminary findings to inform subsequent analyses. Results highlights of these employer working groups are presented, and select employer representatives serving as discussants on this session's panel shared about the challenges and opportunities they face in working to recruit, retain and advance people with disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies Employer Working Groups:</strong> This project builds on previous project efforts to gain &rdquo;top of the house&rdquo; strategic perspectives from corporate HR. With the 60 CAHRS member companies and access to top-level HR executives, this project aims to identify HR/employer metrics to assess employer practice and policy impacts.</li>
<li><strong>Inside Workplaces:</strong> In contrast to the cross-organizational research design of our other projects, the purpose of this project was to conduct a case study of one federal and one private organization. Results to date highlight the employee&rsquo;s view of three primary issues emerging across several other related Cornell research projects: 1) self-disclosure, both of one&rsquo;s disability status and also of one&rsquo;s need for an accommodation; 2) perceptions related to disability discrimination (including factors that impact their likelihood); and 3) employee and managerial perceptions of, and experiences with (where applicable), disability policies and practices within their organization.</li>

34,"Initial Impact of Section 503 Rules: Identifying Employer Practices and Trends in Disability Violations among Federal Contractors",,,,"<p>In March 2014, regulations went into effect related to the implementation of Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (Section 503). These regulations set new requirements for federal contractors and subcontractors related to nondiscrimination and affirmative action in the employment of qualified individuals with disabilities. For example, contractors now are required to offer applicants and employees the opportunity to self-identify as a person with a disability and to use the data collected to understand their progress toward a 7% utilization goal for employment of individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this project is to understand the initial impact of these regulations on employer practices and consequently on the employment environment for individuals with disabilities. The study uses both existing administrative and survey data to achieve three supporting objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the characteristics of firms with and without evidence of a disability violation under EEO laws.</li>
<li>Examine the initial impact of changes to Section 503 regulations on the observed patterns of employers with disability violations.</li>
<li>Build an understanding of effective practice and policy as contractors have initially responded to Section 503 regulations.</li>

38,"Transition Services and Rehabilitation Approaches for Justice-Involved Youth and Adults with Disabilities",,,,"<p>Unique issues and challenges exist for justice-involved people with disabilities, requiring person-centered planning and approaches to rehabilitation and community re-entry that account for intersectional identities. The Yang-Tan Institute (YTI) has contributed to addressing these critical needs for more than 30 years and continues to engage in research and outreach efforts focused on these issues, as the number of justice involved people has grown and the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities and other marginalized identities have become more complex.</p>","<p>The United States leads the world in the number of people incarcerated, under parole, on probation, or with a criminal record. Having even a minor criminal record can present major obstacles to employment.<sup>1</sup> Additionally, criminal justice involvement has implications for access to housing, financial benefits, healthcare, and political participation. People with disabilities experience disproportionate risk of arrest and incarceration. Individuals in state and federal prisons are nearly three times as likely to have a disability, and four times as likely to have a cognitive disability, as the general population, while one in five prison inmates has a serious mental illness.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;National estimates of the rate of disability among incarcerated youth range from 40% to 70%.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Substantial overlap exists with disability issues and justice-related issues: (1) overlap of disability issues and incarceration risk factors (e.g., educational/employment barriers); (2) experience of disability in the incarceration setting; (3) youth and juvenile justice-specific issues; and (4) opportunities for inter-sectional thinking in rehabilitation practices and frameworks (e.g., vocational rehabilitation).</p>
<p>In the area of criminal justice involvement, YTI&rsquo;s work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Inmate to Citizen 5-year research demonstration project that designed and tested a person-centered approach supporting the assessment, treatment, and discharge planning of inmates with disabilities, for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). YTI faculty worked with the three Special Needs Units (SNUs) in New York State to train both corrections and civilian personnel on person-centered practices and to provide organizational development support to aid the SNUs in integrating these practices into their existing policies and procedures.</li>
<li>A Comprehensive Needs Assessment for the New York State Adult Career and Continuing Education Services - Vocational Rehabilitation (ACCES-VR), which considered Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) &ldquo;barriers to employment&rdquo; and successful service delivery to out-of-school youth, including justice-involved youth; the needs assessment included a cultural competence and organizational capacity survey of vocational rehabilitation professionals and community service providers, focus groups, and secondary data analysis.</li>
<li>A 2018 summer fellowship for ILR students focusing on issues of intersectionality for justice-involved youth with disabilities.</li>
<li>Current research about the role of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&rsquo;s (IDEA &ldquo;Manifestation Determination Review&rdquo; as a procedural safeguard for preventing justice involvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these projects has demonstrated that disability is an important, but often overlooked, intersectional identity in juvenile justice trends and in mass incarceration more broadly. This topic is given considerable attention in the &ldquo;Intersectionality in Disability Studies&rdquo; course, established by YTI/ILR faculty in 2017. YTI&rsquo;s efforts to foster equitable treatment within law enforcement, education, employment, and other domains are coupled with initiatives designed to empower justice-involved youth and adults to re-enter their communities through person-centered planning.</p>

176,"Improving VR Outcomes for Out-of-School Youth Involved in the Justice and/or Foster Care Systems",,,,"<p>During this 3-year project, Cornell University&rsquo;s Yang-Tan Institute will conduct mixed method exploratory research to learn how the public Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) program can effectively serve out-of-school youth (ages 16&ndash;24) with intellectual, developmental, and mental health disabilities who are involved in the justice and/or foster care systems, ultimately contributing to the outcome domain of employment.</p>
<p>The research will also focus on unique considerations pertaining to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic downturn, which have created an even more pressing need to address service gaps for these youth. These youth are more likely to experience skills gaps from educational interruptions and digital divides, and they are less likely to access VR services. Also, these youth will be entering the employment market during this challenging time.</p>
<p>The goals of the study are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore issues of population identification, outreach, and service delivery from both practitioners&rsquo; and youths&rsquo; perspectives.</li>
<li>Determine VR practitioners&rsquo; utilization of evidence-based, culturally appropriate interagency approaches towards identification, outreach, and service for these populations.</li>
<li>Explore how the pandemic has changed the ways that systems-involved youth are willing or able to engage with VR services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objectives of the study are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase understanding of the experiences of system-involved out-of-school youth with disabilities in accessing and benefiting from VR services</li>
<li>Identify effective approaches for connecting out-of-school youth, and their families, with VR services in order to improve employment outcomes.</li>
</ul>","<p>Outcomes will include evidence from three primary research activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus groups and interviews with out-of-school youth and their families as well as with VR and other service professionals (e.g., justice and foster care personnel)</li>
<li>A follow-up survey to obtain quantitative data about VR experiences across these four types of stakeholders</li>
<li>Stakeholder feedback on the initial design of products. These products will include one multimodal, pilot-tested toolkit (e.g., web, text/pdf, images, checklist, video) for VRCs and related professionals, as well as CRCC-accredited webinar trainings for these groups.</li>

<li>Understanding the needs of New Yorkers with disabilities who have been historically marginalized and unserved or underserved (i.e., individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals living in poverty, youth in foster care)</li>
<li>Exploring the capacity of community rehabilitation providers to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, including traditional employment services providers (e.g., supported employment, direct placement), postsecondary education and training providers (colleges and proprietary schools), assessment providers (psychological), and assistive technology</li>
</ul>","<p>The proposed needs assessment activities are conceptualized across three phases:</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Comparative assessment of needs&mdash;NYS needs in context</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this activity is to conduct a high-level analysis using a variety of data sources to paint a composite picture of the need for VR services in New York State.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2: Refining needs with Group Concept Mapping</strong></p>
<p>In this phase, using the Group Concept Mapping (GCM) process, the project will explore the question of &ldquo;<em>What does an effective, progressive, and culturally responsive vocational rehabilitation program that services the diverse needs of youth and adults with disabilities include?&rdquo; </em>The YTI research team, in partnership with ACCES-VR leadership and the SRC, will utilize GCM to obtain the perspective of five groups who are critical to understanding the VR context within New York State:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals with disabilities</li>
<li>Youth and families</li>
<li>WIOA Partners: Labor (Titles I and III), Adult Education (Title II), Perkins</li>
<li>Community Rehabilitation Providers: These include, but are not limited to, traditional employment services providers (e.g., supported employment, direct placement), postsecondary education and training providers (colleges, proprietary schools, vocational training programs), assessment providers (psychological), and assistive technology/rehabilitation technology, driver rehabilitation, and adjunct services</li>
<li>ACCES-VR staff</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 3: Finalizing needs with focus groups</strong></p>
<p>The YTI team, in partnership with ACCESS-VR and SRC, will use the outcomes of the sorting and rating process to identify a targeted group of stakeholders from Phase 2 (up to 50 participants) to engage in an in-depth focus group process. This process will&nbsp;review the findings of the summary reports and&nbsp;seek clarification on the gaps identified in the GCM process, in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify barriers to filling these gaps</li>
<li>Gain feedback on strategies and suggestions to consider on strengthening services</li>
