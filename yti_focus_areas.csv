1,"Inclusive Workplaces","<p>People with disabilities are significantly under-represented in the labor market, a missed opportunity for both employers and individuals. While much research and outreach has focused on the supply-side barriers to employment, a better understanding of the demand-side (employers) is essential to fully address this issue. By increasing our understanding of how employer practices are related to employment disparities and the workplace experiences of individuals with disabilities, we aim to advance workplaces that are inclusive of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>A key component in our research and the development of our programing is engagement with a wide range of employers. By understanding their information needs, we can design studies and products that employers can and will use to inform workplace policy and practices. Our multi-disciplinary research team uses a wide range of methodological approaches to better understand the context, issues, and “what works” across the employment process including in: recruitment and hiring, workplace climate and inclusion, compensation and benefits, accommodation and accessibility, retention and career development, and metrics to measure progress on employer goals in these areas. We offer training, technical assistance, and consultation that are grounded in research and designed to support changes in individual behavior and organizational practice. </p>
<p>Many employers are trying to understand how to encourage employees to self-identify to meet goals set for federal contractors. Our research delving into the barriers and facilitators to disability disclosure from the perspective of individuals with disabilities, as well as in-depth organizational case studies, have helped us provide research based recommendations to employers to improve the workplace climate for disability inclusion and increase self-identification among their applicants and employees.</p>

2,"Workforce Development","<p>Labor force participation relies on the bridging of labor supply and demand. For jobseekers with disabilities, both general and disability-specific placement professionals often serve as catalysts between jobs and employers. Despite the importance of this role, research has shown that people with disabilities continue to experience disparate employment and economic outcomes when compared to their non-disabled peers, leaving researchers, policy makers, and practitioners alike wondering why.</p>
<p>The Yang-Tan Institute designs, conducts and evaluates an array of learning opportunities for both people with disabilities and the professionals who support careers for people with disabilities. Our goal is to empower both of these groups to develop meaningful careers and mutually beneficial relationships with employers. The Yang-Tan Institute strongly believes in situated learning for professionals, which provides tools to improve relationships with employers, and tools that support practical application of new knowledge in practitioners&rsquo; daily work. All of our research, training and technical assistance to employment support professionals is grounded in the realities they face within the context of their service delivery systems; ensuring relevance and applicability to meet ever-changing stakeholder demands.</p>
<p>Support to jobseekers with disabilities is provided by tools designed to help develop leadership skills, understand their rights as people with disabilities, and understand the labor market they seek to enter or remain in. Faculty and Staff at YTI use interactive web sites, distance learning tools, and in-person training which allows people to explore new information using a number of learning approaches.</p>","Enhancing meaningful participation of individuals with disabilities in the existing labor market or other entrepreneurial ventures.","2000-01-01 00:00:00","2020-03-30 20:18:16","work",
3,"Income","<p>U.S. Census data is compelling—one in five American households report an experience of disability, and of those, one in three are living in poverty.  Disability has been found to be both a cause and consequence of poverty which can lead to living, learning and earning barriers which result in education, employment and economic hardship.  The poverty rate for people with disabilities is over two times higher than that for people without disabilities. Disability and poverty go hand-in-hand and people with disabilities are much more likely to experience material hardships such as difficulty meeting basic subsistence needs and getting medical care—leaving them challenged to find a pathway out of poverty and a life of dependence on public entitlements. </p>
<p>The Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability strives to improve the lives and economic well-being of individuals with disabilities.  One way to do so is by opening the workforce to these individuals.  Financial and benefits literacy is a critical skill that needs to be developed in order to reach financial and personal independence.  While the number of disability programs has grown exponentially over the past two decades to over 250, the rules governing the programs are complicated, leaving the individuals with disabilities who want to navigate a path to greater economic and independence challenged.  Despite government’s efforts to create a number of new policy solutions to support these pathways out of poverty, they have yet to realize their full potential impact.</p>
<p>YTI attempts to support these new policy solutions in recognizing their full potential in three ways:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Through our coursework we train practitioners—equipping them to develop comprehensive benefits analysis and work incentives plans to support full employment. YTI currently offers a 16-course certificate program to equip benefits and work incentives practitioners, as well as works in collaboration with other University partners to advance federally-sponsored work incentives planning and assistance.</li>
<li>Through our research we test new and innovative policy and practice solutions to gain a better understanding of what the right mix of services and supports are to maximize individual employment, education, and economic outcomes.  YTI is currently mid-stream in a statewide research demonstration to test new approaches for ensuring the successful school to work transition of youth and their families who receive Supplemental Security Income.</li>
<li>Through our technical assistance and consultation we work with external stakeholders to build their state and local capacity to meet the benefits and work incentives planning needs of individuals with disabilities.  YTI is currently involved with four states in increasing systems capacities to be response to the needs of individuals with disabilities who receive public entitlements.</li>
<li>Through direct support we have helped countless individuals achieve their economic and employment goals.  Joseph was a homeless individual who lived in the State of Maryland.  He contacted the Institute requesting a scholarship for the Work Incentive Planner credentialing course.  We worked with Joseph to secure computer access at his local public library and provided him with a full scholarship for the course.  Today, Joseph is a credentialed work incentives planner and works full time for the State of Maryland providing both planning services and an example of success to his client population.</li>
<p>The social insurance team at the Yang-Tan Institute has used its skill and knowledge to provide direct results for public benefits recipients with disabilities across the United States in order to bring work, financial well-being and community participation into their lives.</p>

4,"Healthy Living & Employee Well-being","<p>YTI recognizes that access to healthcare and wellness of individuals with disabilities is essential to quality of life, as it contributes to improved functioning for finding and retaining jobs in a competitive labor market. Healthy living initiatives will continue to grow in importance with the aging of America’s workforce. Further, wellness-related activities such as those available through employer-sponsored wellness programs or leisure time pursuits, provide opportunities to explore interests, develop skills, and establish friendships with colleagues and peers around common interests. These outcomes can enhance social capital, contribute to greater job satisfaction and aid in coping with the potential work-related and life stressors associated with disability.  Improved work-related functioning is also dependent on equitable access to necessary medical and preventative services, which are especially important for employed individuals with disabilities. YTI emphasizes the role of health and well-being as being one the core pillars in expanding capabilities and equal opportunities for engaging in work for persons with disabilities. </p>
<p>YTI, in collaboration with various state, regional, national and international partners, along with members of the disability community, conducts research related to topics such as work/life balance and disability and inclusive worksite wellness programming and understanding factors related to health disparities among people with disabilities. We also engage in evaluation of the physical and programmatic accessibility of recreation sites and wellness-related programs with an emphasis on how these resources can be more inclusive and expand the array of wellness options available to individuals with different types of disabilities. We extend our expertise by examining contemporary healthcare policy and regulatory environments on healthcare access, preventative health and healthcare outcomes for people with disabilities. </p>
<p>Since 2013, YTI faculty have educated more than 400 recreation and fitness professionals, architects, and policymakers about inclusive wellness. We also conducted a pilot study about the use of worksite wellness programs by employees with disabilities, an emerging issue given the recent EEOC rulings regarding these employer-sponsored offerings. Additionally, in a current study of work/life balance and disability, we have collected data about the experiences of more than 600 individuals with a wide range of disabilities about negotiating work, life, and disability management; this has informed the creation of a new model of work-life-disability management which will add to existing literature on this topic. Further, the study has provided data about workplace bullying and harassment experienced by individuals with disabilities, an issue that is of increasing interest to the EEOC.  In addition, YTI faculty, through their collaboration with Weill Cornell Medical College, educated internal medicine residents on providing clinical care for people with disabilities and shared resources with their clinical faculty on impact of work on improved rehabilitation outcomes. Examining state and national administrative datasets faculty members continue to assess the contribution of health in employment of people with disabilities. YTI faculty have also studied the contexts of healthcare organizations in understanding the structuration and delivery of care for people with disabilities and chronic health conditions, including the contemporary models of Accountable Care Organizations.</p>

5,"Community Membership","<p>For more than three decades, individuals with disabilities, their families and other allies have advocated for individualized services and supports as the single most effective path leading to social and community inclusion.  Response to the demand for person-driven, or person-centered support has been inconsistent and primarily system driven.  In 2014, federal authorities governing disability services throughout the United States passed regulation requiring that all federally funded disability service programs design and deliver person-driven services that result in greater opportunity and experience in typical community life for individuals with disabilities.  For many disability organizations, meeting the regulation requires system enhancement and service delivery transformation.</p>
 
<p>The Yang-Tan Institute recognizes that to be person-driven means to assist the person with a disability and his or her family to be the authority in their own life and that resources are used to support the individual's pursuit of a good life.  This requires service providers to fully explore and understand what a person wants for their life and offer assistance that opens equal access to opportunities through which to explore, discover and find expression for individual interests, potential and capacity for contribution as a citizen in society.  This is a hands on practical approach that gathers important information and direction from the person by ""doing with.""  In this way, the person becomes the leader and the service provider assists.  </p>
<p>We have witnessed positive exponential impact for enhancing community membership opportunities and experiences for people with disabilities as a result of using this approach. This has been especially evident in the international Citizen-Centered Leadership Development distance learning course through which participants from around the world access expert theory and connect to relevant resources and tools explicitly designed to empower people with disabilities to assume important and respected roles in society.  A critical discussion point that runs throughout the course asks participants to reflect upon and take action around this question:  <em>What kind of leadership needs to be activated today that will promote the focus of mainstream social inclusion in generations to come?</em> </p>
<p>Similarly, the Yang-Tan Institute is the host to an innovative national model of leadership training for people with developmental disabilities, parents and family members through the New York State Partners in Policy Making learning community,  This project provides state-of-the-art knowledge and field-based exercises to participants who aspire to influence policy development at all levels in New York State.</p>
<p>Long considered a resource to service provider organizations wishing to enhance or improve person-driven community membership opportunities, we have spearheaded ground breaking initiatives such as a five year Inmate to Citizen Project initiated and implemented within maximum and medium security correctional facilities serving individual with developmental disabilities.   Currently the Yang-Tan Institutes provides system impact and system transformation consultation and training resources to state  operated psychiatric centers whose goal is to transform traditional center-based services to inclusive community-based.</p>

6,"Education","<p>In New York City, the monolithic 69th Regiment Armory contains a high school-age special education classroom where students with disabilities learn academic skills within a context of building, construction, and remodeling.  They build to code, use power tools, and work as a team.  Each finished product is in fact a demonstration of an array of skill mastery that cannot be found in a traditional classroom setting.  Carlos was one of the graduates of this program.</p>

<p>After graduation, Carlos walked by a Bronx barbershop.  He saw the owner attempting to remodel the the shop and pointed out a better way of accomplishing the same work.  The owner asked him how he learned these skills.  Carlos said, “Look, I went to trade school for this.”  The owner asked him to show up for work the next day.  From Carlos’ point of view, career development is an ongoing process that combines ambition, learning practical skills, and a long term view of things: “I want to work in a big-ass building and build stuff.”</p>

<p>Successful transitions to adult life happen one young person at a time, with the support and guidance provided by family members, educators, and community partners – including businesses.  The transition process begins with individualized, student-centered and future-focused planning, with an understanding that many future careers have not yet been created.  Our systems of education, community support, and career development must therefore be agile, reflecting the changing labor market, culture, and talents of all youth, including youth with disabilities.</p>

<p>Through years of research, the Yang-Tan Institute has developed practical solutions that are resulting in new opportunities for youth with disabilities. We leverage interactive web sites and distance learning tools so audiences from diverse locations, can explore ideas through online discussion, planning and reflection.  Our professional development work with educators and agency professionals inspires shared leadership and broadly adopted innovations. Overall, we are engaging in a collaborative dialogue among policymakers, agency professionals, businesses, families and students -- advancing positive outcomes for youth with disabilities.  </p>

7,"Engaged Learning","<p>Research has shown that experiential learning that involves and engages learners directly with the phenomenon they are studying, rather than merely thinking about the encounter or only considering the possibility of doing something with it, maximizes the likelihood the learner will put the new knowledge into action.  Educational theorists have indicated that there is a critical link needed between the learning environment and the future work for which the learner is being prepared.  Competence in a particular area is not only defined by the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, but also the adaptive skills necessary for application of that knowledge in a dynamic environment.  While most classroom-based learning often involves decontextualized abstract knowledge, meaningful learning is situated within normally occurring activity, context and culture.  Our own research has shown that when these instructional strategies and approaches are used, learners demonstrate not only achievement of learning objectives, but more importantly behavioral objectives.</p>
<p>The Yang-Tan Institute designs, conducts, and evaluates an array of experiential and situated learning opportunities—spanning across both pre- and post-service learning.  Across these learning opportunities, we employ several learning strategies, including: authentic environments and activities; instructional scaffolding and resources; reflection; expert modeling; and, observation.  </p>
<p>In 2009, we launched a sequence of disability studies courses within the ILR School—ranging from Disability Law to Disability Considerations in Human Resource Policy and Practice, these pre-service courses impact about 250 students a year from across the Cornell campus—all of whom are seeking ways to integrate disability knowledge into their chosen careers.  The Disability and Employment Global Applied Learning Initiative within the Yang-Tan Institute enables Cornell students to connect their classroom learning, reflection, personal growth, and civic responsibility to meaningful international service experiences related to disability and the workplace.  For practitioners already in the field, the Yang-Tan Institute offers an array of public professional development programs, as well as training programs which can be customized to the needs of end users, and offered in consultation with interested stakeholders. Over the past decade, the Yang-Tan Institute has also pioneered several Just-in-Time Toolkits—providing critical instructional scaffolding and learning tools for practitioners at the point and place in time when they need it most. </p>

8,"Emerging","<p>The Yang-Tan Institute has always embraced and promoted accessibility and inclusive/universal design. With the rise of reliance on technology, it is imperative to make products, software and applications that are available to and usable by everyone. YTI working with Cornell Computer and Information Science (CIS), submitted an application to <a style=""color: #b31b1b; border-bottom: 1px dotted;"" href=""http://teachaccess.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Teach Access</a> and Cornell University is now an educational organization member. In addition, YTI continues to promote accessibility and universal design to Cornell's Information and Technology team.</p>

<p>Unique issues and challenges exist for justice-involved people with disabilities, requiring person-centered planning and approaches to rehabilitation and community re-entry that account for intersectional identities. The Yang-Tan Institute (YTI) has contributed to addressing these critical needs for more than 30 years and continues to engage in research and outreach efforts focused on these issues, as the number of justice involved people has grown and the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities and other marginalized identities have become more complex.</p>
<p>The United States leads the world in the number of people incarcerated, under parole, on probation, or with a criminal record. Having even a minor criminal record can present major obstacles to employment<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, criminal justice involvement has implications for access to housing, financial benefits, healthcare, and political participation. People with disabilities experience disproportionate risk of arrest and incarceration. Individuals in state and federal prisons are nearly three times as likely to have a disability, and four times as likely to have a cognitive disability, as the general population, while one in five prison inmates has a serious mental illness<sup>2</sup>. National estimates of the rate of disability among incarcerated youth range from 40% to 70%<sup>3</sup>.</p>
